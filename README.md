"Chiro (UE4 Mannequin)" is a [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) add-on
for [skinning](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/animation/armatures/skinning/introduction.html)
with Unreal Engine 4 Mannequin armature.

---

## Who is it for

 - **3D Artists**, who want to skin their characters with the Mannequin skeleton
 - **Indie Game Developers**, who want an easy way to swap an armature of a mesh with the Mannequin skeleton


## Why we need it

 - animation created for Mannequin may be reused
 - blueprints created for Mannequin may be reused
 - Mannequin skeleton may be reused


## What it gives you

 - Free software (as in freedom)
 - Skinning with Mannequin compatible armatures
 - FBX export made easy (with correct scale)
 - Mixamo to Mannequin skeleton transformations automation
 - A bunch of automations


## What it does not do

The primary goal of this add-on is to make
[Skinning](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/animation/armatures/skinning/introduction.html) easy.
If you need to animate your characters, you should consider using EpicGames Blender Tools for that (e.g. Unreal to Rigify).

Requires **2.8x**  
Tested with **2.83 LTS**
