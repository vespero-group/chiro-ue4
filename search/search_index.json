Export FBX Conclusion Results Third person Advanced Locomotion System v4 Intro In this article we will skin a character mesh with a mannequin-compatible armature. The mesh proportions are not matching the Mannequin, so we will change the bones and later use retargeting manager in Unreal Engine 4 to make the animation work. The mesh does not have armature, vertex groups and weight paints. Here is the character we will be skinning 1. Add Armature The first step is to add the armature we'll be working with. To do that, find the menu and the armature to the scene. It will be easier to work if we make it show up \"In Front\", so let's do it straight away. Add -> Armature -> Chiro (UE4 Mannequin) -> A-Pose Armature sidebar -> Viewport Display -> In Front Info It does not matter if you start with the armature in A-Pose or T-Pose. In this example we start with A-Pose merely because it's closer to the mesh posture. 2. Scale Armature Now we scale the armature so its spine length following the torso size accordingly. Here are a couple guidelines you could follow to make it right pelvis root should be at the top of the groin clavicle bone tails should be just in the middle of the character shoulders Warning If you cannot find good alignment, then don't align clavicles, just make sure pelvis is in the correct position. In the following steps we will adjust all the bones one by one anyway, but it is important to begin with the pelvis in the right spot. 3. Adjust pelvis position Now we shall adjust the bone positions. However, pelvis is the root for all the other bones and it is important that we begin with it first. To find the correct position for pelvis, you could follow these guidelines. front view: top of the groin, middle of the mesh side view: middle of the mesh, middle of glutes rear view: middle of glutes, middle of the mesh To make it easier, in this step we will move pelvis into a separate layer, so the other bones don't obscure the view. To do that, we are switching to the Edit Mode . Then, we return to the Object Mode and adjust the pelvis position by dragging the armature around. 4. Adjust pelvis tail The rest of the bones we will adjust in Pose mode . Now we are correcting spine_01 position by following these guidelines front view: just below navel side view: middle of the mesh rear view: just above the pelvis Since the bones are connected, to adjust spine_01 position we will update the pelvis bone instead. In Pose Mode we will rotate pelvis and increase its Scale Y . 5. Adjust spine_01 Same here. To adjust spine_02 we will update spine_01 in Pose Mode . Rotate the bone and update its Scale Y to change the bone length. Here are the guidelines for spine_02 adjustments front view: celiac plexus (aka solar plexus), just below the ribcage, top of the abdomen side view: middle of the mesh To do this, we will move the spine_01 bone to the current layer via Edit Mode 6. Adjust spine_02 Repeating the same proceduce to adjust spine_03 position. The guidelines front view: middle of the chest side view: middle of the mesh, below the bottom of armpit, following the shape of the mesh Info To move the bone into current layer we're using shortcuts ( Shift-M and M ). If you're not comfortable with shortcuts, you could repeat the UI actions from the previous steps. The shortcuts are doing the same thing. 7. Adjust neck and head Repeating the procedure for neck and head bones. neck root guidelines: front view: root of the neck, above clavicles side view: root of the neck, just above the shoulders neck tail guidelines: side view: behind the jaw, below the ear head guidelines: parallel to face 8. Adjust clavicles The clavicle bones are the most error prone in retargeting Mannequin animations. Most likely you won't be able to find the correct position for your character from the first try. The shoulders may look broken, or positioned weirdly. To mitigate that effect, find a correct spot for clavicle bone roots. Although, for now, we are going to leave it \"as is\". Info Later we may use the \"auto-detection\" provided by the addon via Snap clavicles to Mannequin position transformation. It won't give you the best possible result, but it is \"good enough\" to begin with. The guidelines turn on X-mirror do not change clavicle root position clavicle tail should be placed in the middle of the shoulder joint 9. Left Arm Following the procedure, we're leaving X-mirror turned on and update the left arm bones. Here are some simple guidelines for that all bones should be placed in the middle of the mesh upperarm_l tail should be placed exactly at the elbow joint lowerarm_l tail should be placed exactly at the wrist joint hand_l tail should be placed at the root of the middle finger 10. Fingers Skin the fingers right is tricky. Although, if you're careful enough, the result should be good. Here are the guidelines for you: roll hand_l bone to find the correct thumb to pinky position drag roots of gingers, place them to match knuckles rotate the rest finger bones to find correct finger positions scale the bones to match finger phalanges make sure X axis of every bone except thumb looks the same way as the palm We are still using X-mirror and only dealing with the left hand. 11. Left leg Now we're ready to proceed with legs. The guidelines are: thigh_l root should be already in a good position, so we don't touch it thigh_l tail should be placed in the knee joint calf_l tail should be placed at the ankle joint foot_l tail should be placed at the beginning of the toes ball_l should be aligned straight forward We're still using X-mirror and only adjust left leg bones. In the process we're also using Select Bone Group: Twist Bones to select all twist bones and move them into a different layer, so they don't obscure the view. 12. Adjust the right side Ideally the mesh will by symmetrical along the X axis. However, the world is not ideal, so we should account for the differences between the left and right sides of the mesh. Turn OFF X-mirror Correct right arm, palm, fingers and leg 13. Apply the pose as Rest Pose We have the armature in the correct pose precisely following the mesh posture and proportions. Now we need to apply all our changes to the armature by applying the pose as Rest Pose. 14. Parent the armature It is time to parent the mesh with the armature. Ideally you may like to amend the weight paints for the vertex groups, but for the brevity of this tutorial we will use auto-weights and leave it as is. This will give us good enough result for now. 15. T-Pose A requirement for the armature to be mannequin-compatible is correct bone rolls. The Chiro add-on has built-in functionality to correct the rolls. However, to do so properly it needs the character to be in T-Pose. Thus, we will put our mesh into T-Pose now. Here are the guidelines Face: looking straight forward, head is aligned by Z axis Feet: looking straight forward, parallel to the floor Arms: aligned by X axis, parallel to the floor Upper arms: parallel to the floor Elbows: looking straight back (towards Y axis) Palms: parallel to the floor 16. Apply the pose to mesh Before we move on, we need to put the mesh into the new T pose at rest. To do so, we will use Apply Pose to Mesh & as Rest feature. Without it, the mesh will keep its original form and not the T-Pose we've just made for it. Pose -> Apply -> Apply Pose to Mesh & as Rest (Chiro) 16.5. (Optional) Snap clavicles This step is optional, because it may have different results depending on the character. Sometimes it may help with shoulders, sometimes it would make things worse. You should try both ways and choose the best option that suits your character anatomy. Info If you are skinning your character for the first time, we are recommending to skip this step and come back later to try this option if you find that your character shoulders aren't looking properly. We also encourage you to save the progress you've made so far in a separate blend file, so you could come back to this step later and rework not from the very beginning, but from this step. To do that we will use Snap clavicles to Mannequin position transformation. Find and press in the menu: Armature -> Chiro (UE4) -> Mannequin --> Snap clavicles to Mannequin position 17. Fix bone rolls Now we should be able to correct the bone rolls via the Bone Roll T-Pose transformation. Switch to Edit Mode Armature -> Chiro (UE4) -> Mannequin --> Bone Roll T-Pose 18. Fix feet rotation The Bone Roll T-Pose transformation will try to detect the best rotation. However, depending on the actual mesh pose, it will not be correct for some bones. Particularly, if the feet of the mesh don't look straight forward, the roll may be incorrect. Not a big problem. We can fix the rolls manually. To do that: Make sure X-Mirror is turned OFF fix the left foot roll so X axis looks down fix the right foot roll so X axis looks up Warning If your mesh has asymmetry, X-mirror will dislocate the bones, this is why we turn it off Info In this video, we're hiding the obstructive bones by selecting them and pressing H on keyboard. To unhide them later you can press Alt+H . 19. A-Pose The final step before it's ready for exporting. The add-on Export FBX operator relies on the armature to be in A-Pose to correct the bone rotations and make it compatible with the Mannequin armature. Thus, the last step before exporting is to pose it into A-Pose and apply it to the mesh. Similar to what we did with T-Pose before. Go to Pose mode Find and press in menu Pose -> Re-Pose (Chiro UE4) -> \"Mannequin --> A-Pose\" Find and press in menu Pose -> Apply -> Apply Pose to Mesh & as Rest (Chiro) 20. Export FBX Now it is ready for exporting to FBX. However, the add-on has its own Export FBX operator, that uses correct export settings and takes care about some extra stuff that you rarely want to do manually. For more details on the Export FBX operator, see its own documentation section. Note Export FBX operator saves files into the same folder with your current .blend file Warning The export may take some time. Wait until the dropdown disappears from the screen. Info If the proportions of your character are exactly the same as Mannequin (e.g. you did not update any bone scales, only rotations), you might import it with the Mannequin skeleton and reuse animations with no retargeting required. If the proportions are different, you will need retargeting. File -> Export -> FBX (Chiro UE4 Mannequin) -> Save as ***.fbx Step 10: Export to FBX Conclusion The resulting FBX file is ready for use in Unreal Engine 4 with default import settings. Although, most likely it will need animation retargeting in Unreal Engine 4. If you are not sure how to do that, read HowTo: UE4 Retargeting . Results Warning These results are not ideal, because we did not do manual weight painting and mesh correction. The goal is to show you what the add-on is capable of, not to teach how to skin characters professionaly.

Re-Skin Mixamo for Unreal Engine 4 Mannequin Intro 1. Get the character in T-Pose 2. Convert the armature to Mannequin-compatible 3. Connect the bones with children 4. Snap clavicles to Mannequin position 5. Make Twist bones 6. Roll the bones 7. Fix feet rotation 8. Fix finger rotation 9. Re-Pose the Mesh to the Mannequin A-Pose 10. Export FBX Conclusion Intro Mixamo characters may have a variety of armatures. Some of them are more compatible with Mannequin than others. The process described in here will not work for every character you find out there, but should work for some of them. Note Armatures prefixed with mixamo9: appear to be more compatible and easy to convert. Warning Most likely your character has proportions different to the Mannequin does not have twist bones and their weight painted vertex groups Thus, do not expect the character to work without later retargeting in Unreal Engine 4 the retargeted animation to fit any character perfectly 1. Get the character in T-Pose The easiest way is to download the character in T-Pose. Otherwise, you may have to pose your character manually into the T-Pose before we proceed. Important Make sure the character is placed at the origin (in the middle of the scene) 2. Convert the armature to Mannequin-compatible Now we will rename every bone of the armature into its Mannequin counterpart and also delete the redundant leaf bones. To do that, we will use Skeleton conversion transformation. Select the Armature Go to Edit mode Find and press in the menu Armature -> Chiro (UE4) -> Mixamo --> Skeleton conversion Step 2: Skeleton conversion 3. Connect the bones with children Some characters may have incorrect bone orientation. The easiest way to make sure all bones are positioned correctly (or at least similar to the Mannequin), is to connect the bone tails to children. To do that we will use Connect the bones with children transformation. Find and press in the menu: Armature -> Chiro (UE4) -> Mannequin --> Connect the bones with children Step 3: Connect the bones with children 4. Snap clavicles to Mannequin position Most likely your character T-Pose will have clavicle root positions aligned with the spine bone by the X axis. The Mannequin, however, has its clavicle roots displaced forward, which better replicates human anatomy. Later, when retargeting the Mannequin animation in Unreal Engine 4 for our character, this will make an effect of the shoulders stretched back too far, which looks like if scapulae are brought together. To reduce that effect, we can move the clavicle bone roots forward, similar to the original Mannequin armature. To do that we will use Snap clavicles to Mannequin position transformation. Find and press in the menu: Armature -> Chiro (UE4) -> Mannequin --> Snap clavicles to Mannequin position Step 4: Snap clavicles to Mannequin position 5. Make Twist bones Most likely the character does not have the Mannequin Twist bones. Even though there are no Vertex groups nor Weight paints , we still need those Twist bones to exist so that Unreal Engine 4 can work with the skeleton when we retarget Mannequin animation. This is important for the engine that all the bones exist and precisely reproduce the original skeleton hierarchy. To do that we will use Make twist bones transformation. Warning This transformation generates the bones only . It does not generate any Vertex Groups with Weights. If you want your character to be more compatible with retargeted animation, you may need to manually Weight paint those Vertex Groups. Armature -> Chiro (UE4) -> Mannequin --> Make Twist bones Step 5: Make Twist bones 6. Roll the bones The Mixamo characters have the bone heads and tails properly placed out of the box, same as the Weights for the Vertex Groups. However, an important difference with the Mannequin is the bones are rolled differently. Fret not, you don't have to re-roll every bone manually as long as your character is carefully posed in T-Pose. As long as it is the case, the add-on can detect proper rolls for every bone. Then you may correct the small bits manually if you'd like. Although, usually it will have \"good enough\" result without manual changes. Warning It is important that the Mesh is in correct T-Pose : Face: looking straight forward, head is aligned by Z axis Feet: looking straight forward, parallel to the floor Arms: aligned by X axis, parallel to the floor Upper arms: parallel to the floor Elbows: looking straight back (towards Y axis) Palms: parallel to the floor Note Usually Mixamo in T-Pose will have the correct posture out of the box. After we make sure the mesh is in the correct T-Pose, we may reroll the bones. To do that we will use Bone Roll T-Pose transformation. Armature -> Chiro (UE4) -> Mannequin --> Bone Roll T-Pose Step 6: Roll the bones 7. Fix feet rotation The Bone Roll T-Pose transformation will try to detect the best possible rotation. However, depending on the actual mesh pose, it will not be correct for some bones. Particularly, if the feet of the mesh don't look straight forward, then the roll will not be correct. Not a big problem. We can fix the rolls manually. To do that: turn on X-Mirror fix the left foot roll so X axis looks down Warning Right foot bone X-axis should look straight up, but with X-mirror that will be auto-corrected Step 7: Fix feet rotation 8. Fix finger rotation Same as with feet, finger rolls may need manual update so every X axis of every finger bone (except thumb) looks straight down, following the palm direction. turn on X-Mirror fix the left arm fingers so that X axes look down Warning The palm should be looking down as well. This is X-axis of the hand_l bone Step 8: Fix finger rotation 9. Re-Pose the Mesh to the Mannequin A-Pose Before we can export the character to FBX, we have to re-pose it into Mannequin A-Pose. This is necessary so that add-on may transform the bone rotations later when exporting to FBX. We will omit the technical details here, but this is necessary for the character to get exported correctly. To do that Go to Pose mode Find and press in menu Pose -> Re-Pose (Chiro UE4) -> \"Mannequin --> A-Pose\" Find and press in menu Pose -> Apply -> Apply Pose to Mesh & as Rest (Chiro) Step 9: Re-Pose Mesh to Mannequin A-Pose 10.
